# SmoothTensorDecompositionABPM

This is a repository for the implementation of the paper "Smooth Tensor Decomposition with Application to Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Data". The implementation dependends on the [`SmoothHOOI` R package](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/SmoothHOOI).

## HYPNOS Application

This folder includes code for reproducing the results in Section 4 of the paper.

## Simulation Studies

This folder includes code for reproducing the results in Section 3 of the paper. 

- `missing_rate`: random missingness
- `missing_struc`: structured missingness
- `noise_level`: noise level
- `p`: sample size

## Synthetic Example

This folder presents a synthetic example that shows the workflow of this study and the usage of the [`SmoothHOOI` R package](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/SmoothHOOI).
